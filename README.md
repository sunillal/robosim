# robosim
Robotic simulator for the [brittle star robot project] (http://sunillal.github.io/Site/Research.html)

## Install open dynamics engine
To use this simulator you need to download and install [open dynamics engine] (https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode/) for your platform.

## Install the robotic simulator
Place the robosim directory under the ode directory, eg: ../ode-0.13.1/robosim

In the robosim directory, compile the source and create executable 

$ make all

Run the simulator passing the parameter file (sfile.txt) as an input

$ ./roboSim sfile.txt

## Performing simulations

The sfile.txt is the parameter file which governs how the simulations are performed.
